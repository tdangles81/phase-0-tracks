# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is software peoples' version of a time machine. Mistakes get made, and when they do, version control allows programmers to create save points, then revert to them if necessary.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a duplicate of the main repository. It allows programmers to make changes to the working version, without the chance of actually affecting the working version's code. When the feature branch is where it should be, it can be added to the main codebase.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is just that-a commitment. This is a save point, like in a video game, and typically commits are of working versions. A good commit message would describe the changes made in a short, concise, way so that others can read it.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when there's a discrepancy between the main or master branch and the code being pushed. For instance, If text is originally green in the xib of the master branch, and it is changed to red in the feature branch, a merge conflict will result from this that must be solved.
