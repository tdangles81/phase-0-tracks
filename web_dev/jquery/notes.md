Tackling JQuery:

	In order to learn as much as possible about the Javacript JQuery library in a limited time-frame, my methods for studying are as follows:
		1. Get background on JQuery-find out which components of the framework will be the most useful. Also, I intend to figure out how JQuery is similar to previous code projects using JS, such as how it is linked to HTML, and similarities in syntax.

		2. Jot down exactly what it is I intend to do with the JQuery before looking for resources on the topic. From what I know, JQuery is fairly vast and can be used and formatted in a plethora of ways. However, it is important to know what the end goal is while looking up code snippets, answers, etc. What are the specifics of the problem being solved?

		3. Once I have a basic idea of the JQuery implementation into my project, I'll go through the list of JQuery challenges, starting with the largest challenges first, searching for examples of each implementation. Resources include: Github, Stack Overflow, the Dev Bootcamp Facebook page. If I find myself struggling to integrate JQuery at some point in my project, reaching out through forums or Slack seems to be the most promising ways to get direct answers. Chances are, someone else has faced the same code challenges before.

Effective Strategies: 
	-Of the strategies I planned to use in learning JQuery, having a list of functionality that I needed to learn was one of the most effective. For me, having a set of goals for projects allows me to not only visualize the implementation of code, but it gives me an idea of key words or phrases to search for in finding coding solutions.

	-While I relied heavily on other peoples' answers from StackOverflow, there were a few occasions when I needed to reference previous Javascript code with similar syntax. Luckily JQuery is still Javascript, just with a different structure since it gives programmers the convenience of methods instead of having to create functionality from scratch for otherwise "simple" problems. An example would be using HTML tags as a reference for Javascript to manipulate objects. However, instead of naming a variable for a specific tag as in Vanilla JS, JQuery allowed me to use HTML directly when involking its methods.

	-Reaching out to fellow cohort-mates on Slack has proven to be super useful.
