1. Common HTTP status codes are (the most common): 

	1xx, indicates some form of information about the data being requested.

	2xx, indicates that server requests were executed and returned the desired outcome, or showing some level of success.

	3xx indicates that there was some sort of redirect or switch from expected request to another, similar, request.

	4xx indicates that there was some error on the user's (client) end, network or hardware related, that inhibited files from being retrieved.

	5xx indicates that the server was unable to retrieve the expected file for the client from the physical server.

2. The Difference Between GET and POST: 

	GET and POST requests literally have the functionality that they are named for. Data is either gotten (GET) or queried from the server in the form of files, or is posted from the client to the database (POST). An example of GET would be loading a Facebook feed, while an example of POST would be sharing a picture publicly.
