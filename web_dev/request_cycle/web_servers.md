1. The Linux OS is popular due to a few basic design principles:

	Linux is open-sourced meaning it is built upon and improved by a community of developers, rather than a large, super powerful, secretive corporation. Instead, the core of this OS is the community built around it. After comparing the OS' design-wise, I noticed that Linux isn't quite as polished as MacOS (although they're similar), but it's not quite as clunky as Windows. It's somwhere in the middle. However, it was pleasing to find out that it's built by a lot of regular people that value the ability to tinker software at a low level.

	Linux is also known for giving people the ability to manipulate it's code, while other operating systems are closed. A quote from the Linux site puts it this way: "Unix was not designed to stop users from doing stupid things, as that would stop them from doing clever things."

2. Running a VPS is creating a server-like machine from the client using its data. To break it down, if I wanted to set up and modify a personal server and it's storage, I would have to pay for hardware (hard-drives) as well as learn how to run an operating system from that server, and whatever else is required to make a server run efficiently--such as cooling techniques. Instead, I could emulate a remote server from my personal machine, which would be limited by its own CPU and storage capabilities.

3. If you're not performing root tasks in Linux, it's recommended (argued) not to run general programs and operations from within ROOT. Every action taken from within ROOT will manipulate the root (main) operating system in some way. A malicious download would give hackers halfway access to otherwise hard-to-reach files (would not need to log in), or a bug could become permanently embedded in the operating system, which could only be deleted by formatting the hard drive.
